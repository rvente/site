The 2016 Fall cross-country season has come to an end. In a series of interviews, the Latineer asked magistri coaches and discipuli captains to reflect on their achievements so far.

The team is the largest it has been since its founding five years ago. Led by Class I captains Santiago​ ​Hernandez,​ ​Daniel​ ​Meiland, Jennifer​ ​Zhumi,​ ​and​ ​Caroline​ ​Triolo, the team saw an increase in interest from underclassmen. They were supervised by Magister Kenan Jaffe, Magistra Jenna Monahan, and Magistra Maggie Mocete. Between magistri advisers to discipuli captains, the team was led effectively.

 "[Everyone] owned down training schedule and [there was] great help from Monahan and Mocete," says Magister Jaffe on the matter.

However, the increase of members can both help and hurt the team.

"[More runners] provide a lot of depth to our team and the opportunity to have maximum time to grow in strength over the next few years," thinks Magistra Mocete.

However, there aren't enough uniforms for every runner to participate, nor is there sufficient funding to purchase them.

All captains feel they could have trained harder and enjoyed the Cross-Country season more.

Captains Meiland and Zhumi broke their personal records at the 5K race in Prospect Park. Captain Meiland established a high bar with a time of 18 minutes and 43 seconds, while Zhumi set the girls school record with a time of 23 minutes and 41 seconds. Such feats will serve as motivation for future generations of TBLS cross-country runners for years to come.

For the four team captains this is their last year at TBLS. They all are feeling lingering regret about leaving. In the meantime, know that cross-country will begin again in Spring 2017—consider signing up!
