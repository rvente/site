Students often feel like they are not heard. They believe they are not seen as mature or that their opinions are not legitimate. But, with participatory budgeting, they can influence their communities and stimulate change.

Participatory budgeting is a NYC program that offers at least $1 million for participating districts to use. In those districts, a yearlong process allows members of the community to decide what to do with that money.

"It's innovative," says Kaden Sun, a member of Councilman Carlos Menchaca's staff. "It involves people."

In participatory budgeting, all aged 14 and above can vote. Along with a greater age range, immigrants who are not citizens can also vote. The restrictions are simply working, learning, or living in the community and the aforementioned age restrictions. This allows for a full community contribution in the government's decision making regarding financial choices.

First, assemblies are held for a couple of months to brainstorm ideas and projects. Then, after debates and assemblies argue for and against projects, people vote for 5 of the proposed projects. In this process, "the people" truly are the people, rather than simply a few members of the population.

Every year, teenagers volunteer to help with the projects as budget delegates. As a result, participatory budgeting allows those who are not usually encouraged to get involved in government to understand the process and work directly with their local representatives.
