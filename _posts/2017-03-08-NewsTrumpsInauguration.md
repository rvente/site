On January 20th 2016, the nation entered a new era: Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America.

"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world," President Trump said at the start of his Inaugural Address."Thank you."

The ceremony was held in front of the Capitol with an estimated 160,000 people attending. The theme of the inauguration mirrored his slogan throughout his campaign for office--Make America Great Again.  President Trump's inauguration marked the first president without any experience in either military or government. He is also the oldest and wealthiest president ever to be sworn in.

In his Inaugural Address, President Trump stressed the flaws of the past establishment of government and that that he will be the one to revise those flaws. He discussed the hardships he has seen America endure, stating, "Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential."

Following these descriptions of America's shortcoming, he again promised that he will be the one who fix them. "I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never, ever let you down," President Trump assured American citizens..

It is impossible to know what the future might hold, but one resounding sentiment seems likely to impact futures across the globe: for President Trump, "From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, America first."
