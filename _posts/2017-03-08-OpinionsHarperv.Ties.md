First, a disclaimer. I am not taking issue with the existence of the tie in our uniform. That, much to the chagrin of many discipuli, is set in stone. Instead, I want to discuss the specific TBLS design.

Administration, magistri, and discipuli are all familiar with the staple of the TBLS uniform: the infamous purple-and-yellow-and-white-and-blue-striped Brooklyn Latin tie. What may or may not come as a surprise to magistri and staff, however, is the widespread discontent with the appearance of the tie. "It's ugly" one Class II discipulus asserted, when asked his opinion about the tie. Another Class II discipula expanded on this, "The colors are not very vibrant." This lack of enthusiasm around the tie is a missed opportunity for both magistri and discipuli.

The Brooklyn Latin tie has enormous potential as a symbol of our school. A well-liked tie shows the school's investment in its students—a student body that honors its uniform shows its commitment in the school. Everyone's happy! It's a win-win!

Except discipuli don't like the tie. They resent it. Discips are understandably frustrated that they are required to wear what they consider a "tacky," "bland," and "meaningless" formality, day-in and day-out. The tie has become so contentious, Class II discipulus Quinn Accardi even wrote "uniform kills creativity" on his tie. He has worn that tie everyday since—that is until a teacher told him that writing on the tie is not in uniform code, and he was forced to swap it out. The irony of this was seemingly lost on his teacher.

These negative attitudes towards the tie have troubling implications for the school community. Because of their resentment towards the uniform, discipuli do not take pride in their uniform, and there is a widespread sense of disenfranchisement, coupled with resentment towards teachers and administrators, who are often the enforcers of the uniform.

Every day, discipuli wear clothes that are chosen for them. I believe that if our desires around what we have to wear were taken into consideration, the student body would be more open to the uniform. In light of the recent crackdown on the uniform—and the newly initiated ban on patch-pocketed pants—this is hardly an unreasonable request. Discipuli just want to look respectable by their standards as well as by those set by the school.

Our website, it states  "dress well to perform well." I couldn't agree more. Better ties make for higher performing and happier discipuli.
