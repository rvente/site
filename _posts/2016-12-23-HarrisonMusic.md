As a Class II who has been going to TBLS for two years, I have noticed something odd: Brooklyn Latin does not have a music class in its curriculum. Instead, people who have felt the need to satisfy their love for music have turned to clubs: Saltare and A Cappella.

I asked Magistra Rose, who leads A Cappella, if music fits into the curriculum of TBLS.

"Absolutely," she replied. "It is very important for students to have that creative outlet through the form of music."

She noted that discipuli have asked if there were more music options. Of the 25 discipuli in A Cappella, half of them play instruments. Without a music class, these discipuli look elsewhere to play; it can be argued that graded music classes would allow them to do so here. Discipuli who excel at music could earn credit for their skill and understanding of music and at the same time do something they love. But it is imperative to understand why a graded music class has not been implemented into the curriculum, as even Headmaster Gina Mautschke also believes that music is a very important aspect of learning.

TBLS is a very new and small school, opening up to its first freshmen class in 2006. Because of this, our budget still strives for other classes and even IB electives for juniors and seniors. When I asked about if we will ever get music classes, Ms. Mautschke replied, "Given our size and IB elective choices, not in the immediate future." We can only hope that as Brooklyn Latin progresses both in student number and budget, music classes will be available from freshman to senior year.
