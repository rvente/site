Congratulations Titans! In a nail-biter against building rival Lyon's Community school, the Brooklyn Latin Titans were able to conquer them 47-45 and secure their third straight NYSAA Flag Football Championship.

The match took place on Saturday, November 12th, at Roy Wilkins Park in Jamaica, Queens.

The Titans held an early lead in the match.

"[We had] offensive contributions from everyone," Magister Adrian Serrano notes.

However, with two minutes left, Lyons scored a shocking touch down, bringing the score within two points. Nevertheless, the strong defense of the Titans allowed for a solid victory and a three-peat championship win.

Brooklyn Latin's Flag Football team, with its limited roster of opponents, has both strengths and weaknesses.

"The team plays in a small league so we lack variety in the teams we play against," says Kyle Tobia, Class II. "A strength is that regardless if we know each other prior to the season, we always bond as a team and a family."
