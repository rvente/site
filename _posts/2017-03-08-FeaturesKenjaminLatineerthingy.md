As President Trump starts a new era with his presidency, the Latineer would like to  reflect on the eight years Barack Obama held the presidential office and administered the country. Of course, like those before him, President Barack Obama was by no means "perfect president." Yet from the moment he took the oath of office on January 20, 2009, Obama led America through some of its most difficult and tumultuous times. It is now that we, as Americans, must remember some of the most significant events that occurred during Obama's presidency. Here are 5 most memorable moments during his presidency that are undeniably worth celebrating and looking back on:

**Visit to Cuba**

In March of 2016, Obama made a visit to Cuba, being the first president to set foot in that country in nearly 9 decades. Due to their differences in government and difficult relationship, a barrier was formed between Cuba and The United States.  However, this visit started to break down this barrier and improved foreign relations.

**Job Creation**

During the Great Recession, which began in 2007, 8.7 million jobs were lost. With the sudden decline in jobs, the unemployment rate peaked at 10%.  However, Obama steadily erased the job deficit by creating 15 million jobs starting in 2010, the most by any president excluding Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.  This put many Americans back to work and improved the economy tremendously.

**Issuing Obamacare**

During Obama's presidency, healthcare was becoming too costly for Medicare to cover.  As a result, many people were in danger of losing coverage provided by health insurance.  On March 23, 2010, in an effort to reform healthcare, Obama introduced his policy of Obamacare, which gave 95% of the population affordable health insurance.

**Internet Exploded with Memes**

In the days leading up to Obama's resignation, the internet exploded with memes of President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden's "bromance." When referring to their friendship, many described the two as "the two best friends we wished we had" or as the Washington Post put it: a "bond strongest in White House history." Of course, the President's notable charm and charisma fueled the fire as he stated, _'I love that man. He's not just a great vice president, he is a great friend. We've gotten so close in some places in Indiana, they won't serve us pizza anymore.'_ Mr. President, your wit and humour is surely to be missed, but your memes will forever be remembered.

**Marriage Equality**

During his presidency,Obama called for a Supreme Court ruling that required states to recognize gay marriage. Time and time again, he referred to it as a "victory for America." He was even the first president to mention the word "transgender" in a State of the Union address. His rallying cry for equality contributed to significant changes in the LGBTQ+ community as it not only legitimized their relationships, but also reemphasizing their rights as an American. WIth his support, the Supreme Court Justice finally made same-sex marriage legal nationwide on June 26, 2015, affecting millions of Americans nationwide.

With so many memories, accomplishments, and notable qualities, President Obama and his family will surely be remembered and celebrated for years to come.
