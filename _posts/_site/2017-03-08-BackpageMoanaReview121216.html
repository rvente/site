<p>Students at The Brooklyn Latin School know the importance of responsibility and individuality. But many of us have not felt the call to action that the protagonist of Disney’s most recent movie, “Moana”, faces.</p>

<p>“Moana” follows the story of a Polynesian princess, who despite her father’s warnings and lectures sails off on a quest to return the heart of the Island. Alongside her is her companion rooster, Hei Hei. Along the way, she meets Maui, a demigod of Polynesian mythology. Both overcome danger and hardships in order to complete their quest and save Moana’s island.</p>

<p>Moana once again demonstrates the power of Disney, with its catchy songs, developed characters, and invigorating plot. Many songs were by written by Tony award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. But the real show-stopper is Auli’i Cravalho, the voice of Moana. Her singing voice will take anyone’s, who watches the movies, breath away.</p>

<p>As for her character, story director Ron Clements has formed a strong female character who has relationships that are not primarily romance-based. The dynamic between Moana and Maui is best described as quarreling siblings, who learn to work together in the end. Moana is brave and strong, yet holds the vulnerability that makes her a fully developed character.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a princess from the Islands is part of a new era in Disney movies where more cultures are being represented in the mainstream media. Many fans praised the inclusion of more WOC in the Disney Princess universe, including Mulan and Tiana.</p>

<p>Overall, Moana is a must-see for anyone who enjoys music and well-rounded characters and plots.</p>
