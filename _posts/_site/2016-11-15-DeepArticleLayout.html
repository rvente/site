<p>As we approach the conclusion of November, the feeling of returning to high school life is finally settling in. The transition from summer vacation to a full school year is a tough one for most, especially for the youngest members of our school community: Class IV.</p>

<p>For many incoming discipuli, our specialized high school workload is much harder than what they faced in middle school. Zoe Law, Class IV, stated that “the workload isn’t that bad, especially since we’re freshmen. I feel like the teachers go easier on us. But the workload is enough to keep me busy for like 2-3 hours.” On the same note, Brianna Joseph, Class IV, believes that “the workload [is] very similar to middle school” for her and hence has had a simple transition.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Latin strives to provide the best learning environment possible through a group of dedicated staff members, teachers, and counselors. Ms. Law “[feels] like the community is very welcoming” and appreciates that there are many “upperclassmen who are always willing to help [her] with anything.”</p>

<p>Additionally, Ms. Joseph was quite impressed by magistri-discipuli relations. To her, “the teachers know what they’re teaching and do indeed teach it pretty well.” Regarding seminar and declamation—distinctive  traditions upheld since our origin in 2006—Ms. Law stated that “things like declamation and seminar are very exciting,” despite the fact that they can be intimidating to many discipuli.</p>

<p>The transition from middle school to high school is not simple, yet there do exist freshmen have handled it successfully and diligently thus far. Despite their views and results being mixed, one idea remains constant: they cannot wait to spend these next four years as members of the Brooklyn Latin community.</p>
