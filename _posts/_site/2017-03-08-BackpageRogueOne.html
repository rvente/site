<p>“I am one with the force—the force is with me” rings the mantra of warrior-monk Chirrut Îmwe in the latest film in the Star Wars universe: “Rogue One.” The force was indeed with “Rogue One” as it earned more than 800 million dollars its opening weekend. Chronologically, “Rogue” One” falls between Episodes 3 and 4, filling in the events leading up to the destruction of the first Death Star. The plot centers around Jyn Erso, the daughter of a scientist forced by the Empire to help build a planet-destroying weapon: the Death Star. As a child, Imperial Deathtroopers stormed Jyn’s planet, killing her mother, and kidnapping her father. Jyn went on to be raised by rebel leader Saw Gerrera. In “Rogue One,” we find Jyn as a wily young woman entangled in a quest to steal the very plans for the Death Star her father was being forced to build. Joining her is a diverse cast, which includes Imperial defector Bodhi Rook (Pakistani actor Riz Ahmed) and Captain Cassian Andor (Mexican actor Diego Luna). Overall, “Rogue One” is a well-crafted Star Wars story that artfully connects the original and prequel trilogies.</p>
