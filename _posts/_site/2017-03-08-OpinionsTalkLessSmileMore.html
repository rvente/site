<p>The question is simple: should we simplify our word choice when talking in seminar? Here are our thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>Ralph:</strong> We shouldn’t sacrifice our freedom of diction just to appeal to larger audience. We should be able to use the words that we want to express our ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> I think that the use of academic jargon can be harmful when speaking in seminar because your message becomes lost in your frills of your vocabulary. It’s exclusionary. Is it not in your best interest to project your ideas so that the group as a whole can understand?</p>

<p><strong>R:</strong> Elevated language isn’t meant to harm the core message. Of course, there are people out there using a word just because it’s long or sounds nice so that they sound clever. They aren’t always thinking about their intended message. We shouldn’t discredit the power of language just because a few people aren’t using it right. A real world example? You can’t say people should use always screwdrivers instead of wrenches. The blame falls on the mechanic for using the wrong tools for the job.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It isn’t realistic to expect someone to completely vanquish sophistication from their speech. I argue that moderation is the answer. When using complex language, small misunderstandings can compound, ultimately degrading understanding of your overarching point. Doesn’t that detract from your purpose as an orator?</p>

<p><strong>R:</strong> There will always be people that don’t understand your language. Why not make your point more approachable for those who do understand you by using words that perfectly fit your thoughts? I agree with you when you argue for moderation, but I don’t think anyone should be limited in what words they use.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Seminar is meant to broaden understanding of a topic through educated discussion. If people don’t understand, that’s an issue: understanding is crucial to a productive seminar. While academic jargon can often be more condensed, that doesn’t always result in clarity. For example, “infinitesimal” versus “really really small.” Both accurately portray the same idea. Which do you think is more specific?</p>

<p><strong>R:</strong> Since familiarity with the phrase is assumed, we can focus on our core argument. A good speaker defines new terms. If not, it never hurts to ask them. We’re building out collective vocabulary.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> It is impractical for students in seminar to Google a word or Latin phrase they’ve never heard. I’d rather a peer reflect on revelations of an idea I present rather than the meaning of some obscure word.</p>

<p><strong>R:</strong> Well, yeah I see what you’re saying. At the same time though, I can’t help but appreciate the fact that your language is really sophisticated and elegant, and I think it really gives your argument a real “wow” factor.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I like that your speech is really simple and to the point.</p>

<p><strong>R:</strong> Maybe we both need a bit of our own advice.</p>
