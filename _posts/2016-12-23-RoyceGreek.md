Led by Magister David Turner, the new Greek II course at TBLS is in full swing. The class consists of around 20 discipuli, and, so far, feedback has been positive.

In a school based around classical education, Ancient Greek has helped many discipuli with their studies.

Joel Camilo, Class III, notes, "Greek and Latin are similar in a lot of ways, and a lot of words have fit together nicely. I feel like this class is helping me in that regard."

The course serves as an alternative to Class III and IV Spanish, and it is also being offered as an IB elective, making Brooklyn Latin one of the only public schools in the world that offers Greek at such a level. In order to take the course this year students had to first undergo a summer course—with the same hours as summer school—in order to brush up on the year of Greek they would've received freshman year.

"It was vigorous," says Mohamed Rahman, Class III, in regards to the summer course. "The work was hard, and there was no air conditioning, but overall it was a fun experience. I'm glad I went."

The Greek course meets R2, with most students having Latin directly before, which serves to further enhance students understanding of both languages. As a school so deeply rooted in the classics of Greek and Rome, many view the course as a refreshing additional aspect of culture integrated into our curriculum.
