# Headmaster’s Corner

by Headmaster Gina Mautschke-Mitchell

When I read the article from the last issue about Mr. Stromoski, I couldn’t help but react in a way to let all discipuli know that even without his presence, the TBLS culture and discipuli life will not change. Although Mr. Stromoski was the Assistant Head Master for Dicipuli Life, the TBLS culture will not end with his departure.

While it is true that Mr. Stromoski’s blood (TBLS purple blood of course) is woven into the fabric and foundation of our school, our culture is based on values traditions from Boston Latin dating back to 1635 and Brooklyn Latin dating back to 2006. We are all a piece of the TBLS culture. Mr. Stromoski may have been the “face” of discipuli life, but we want you to know and trust that there are 60 magistri and staff that care deeply for you and want to offer advice and guidance that you may have received from Mr. Stromoski.

The article mentioned discipline being on a steady decline, an increase of hallway disarray, the incorrect use of the up/down staircases, and a decrease of uniform enforcement. We are all responsible to uphold the TBLS culture that Mr. Stromoski embodied so easily. These anecdotes about the perception of TBLS discipuli life remind me of a quote by J.C Watts that inspires me: “Character is doing the right thing when nobody's looking.”

I challenge you to uphold all aspects of the TBLS culture even though Mr. Stromoski is not watching with either of his different color eyes. I challenge you to embody all the things that he did—and all the things that your magistri and staff do—even without Mr. Stromoski asking you.

At the end of the 2015-2016 school year, magistri and staff discussed splitting the Assistant Head Master of Discipuli Life role by having a few magistri share the responsibilities while teaching. While there were benefits and drawbacks to this model, we ultimately decided we would rather have one person do the role in its entirety and we would be willing to wait to find the best candidate for the role. In the meantime, many magistri and staff are helping with aspects of the role. We know this position is very important and we will find the best candidate to lead Discipuli Life.
