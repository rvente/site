We're a collective of students at Brooklyn Latin with a mutual passion for journalism and the power of the written word. This is the online component to our physically printed newspaper.

This website was made possible by [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) on Github. It was forked by Latineer's Ralph Vente and customized to fit the online news publication format. As of Fall 2017, it is mantained by the Brooklyn Latin School's very own Programming Club.
